# Git-Assignment
1. You need to create five different files in your git repository and commit them in separate commit (i.e. there will be five commits).<br>
1.txt<br>
Do or do not, there is no try.
2.txt
Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.
3.txt
Get busy living, or get busy dying.
4.txt
It's not who I am underneath, but what I do that defines me.
5.txt
I find your lack of faith disturbing.
 2. Then you need to create one branch called "author" and change all files name to below
1.txt > yoda.txt
2.txt > godfather.txt
3.txt > shawshank.txt
4.txt > batman.txt
5.txt > vader.txt
After changing all files name, you need merge this "author" branch into master branch.
3. After this you need to push two different commits in each branch and rebase master branch onto "author" branch. After rebasing you need to merge author branch into master branch again.
i.e.
master -> change yoda.txt
Do or do not, there is no try. -> No try there is, do or do not.
author -> change yoda.txt
Do or do not, there is no try. -> DO OR DO NOT, THERE IS NO TRY.
Then rebase master onto author branch (keep all changes from master branch if there is any conflict). And then merge author branch into master.
After this, you need to push all your changes to Github repository & submit repository link here.
Please verify all your changes (Step 1,2,3) on Github repository before submitting. Assignment evaluation will be based on that only.
